Draft program in HTML5/JS for drafting pokemon to different players. Ran on Chrome 62.0.3202.94 on Windows 10.
Download resources into /resources to run properly.

Yellow indicates the current player picking, red indicates the next player picking.

Standard draft: Player 1 picks first, Player 2 picks second, Player 3 picks third, Player 4 picks fourth, Player 1 picks fifth, etc.

Snake draft: Player 1 picks first, Player 2 picks second, Player 3 picks third, Player 4 picks fourth, Player 4 picks fifth again, Player 3 picks sixth, Player 2 picks seventh, Player 1 picks eighth, Player 1 picks ninth again, etc.

Random: Shuffles the order of the players. Note: Using this button while pokemon have already been picked might result in teams being uneven

Download: Outputs the team contents to the console (Ctrl+Shift+J on Google Chrome)

Reset: Brings the pick back to Player 1, refills the Pokemon roster and empties all player rosters. Does not refresh the player order back to the original (refresh the program to restore player order).

Screenshot1 is when the progam has freshly been open

Screenshot2 had the Player Order shuffled and pokemon picked at random until nothing was left, then the results outputted to the console.
